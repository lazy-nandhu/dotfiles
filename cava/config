[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires
# a terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.
# default is to keep current terminal color

# SDL and sdl_glsl only support hex code colors, these are the default:
; background = '#111111'
; foreground = '#33ffff'


# We are now using the CAVA theme feature to load Matugen colors.

; horizontal_gradient_color_8 = '#434279'


# If both vertical and horizontal gradient is enabled, vertical will be blended in this direction.
# Can be 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right'. 'up' means the vertical gradient will be blended in from
# bottom to top. I.e. the bottom will be only the horizontal
# and top will be only the color of the vertical gradient.
